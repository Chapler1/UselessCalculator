# UselessCalculator
Collaborators: Billy Chapler and Diego Jurado
## What it does
A Calculator that inputs your name and two numbers and does a random calculation with it.
(It never does what you want it to)

## How to use it
It's a basic I/O program, it will ask you for 3 inputs in the terminal: a name, a number, and another number.
It will then output a line in the terminal such as: 
 
 "Hi Jimmy the sum of 2 and 5 is 8"
 
## How to contribute
One could add another random calculation function and a random number generator to determine which 
function to call, leading to different outputs with the same inputs. Overall, the possibilities are 
endless and ultimately the point is to never give the proper answer to the prompt.
